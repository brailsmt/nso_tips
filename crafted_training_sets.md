# Training Sets
All training gear should be crafted such that there is at least one light, one medium, and one heavy armor item.  This
will ensure all armor skill lines are levelled simultaneously.

## Magicka Characters
Magicka characters generally have 8 slots to work with while levelling, there are 7 armor slots plus one for a staff.
This means that most Msgicka based builds utilize a 5 piece bonus from one set, plus a 3 set bonus for another.  Choose
the 3 piece bonus based on whether you would prefer more magicka recovery, or more max magicka.

### DPS
DPS Magicka characters will want to run the following sets w/ training traits:
- Law of Julianos (5 pieces)
    - This is the main set, and is a must have, it is effective even in end game content
- Armor of the Seducer (3 pieces)
    - Use this set or Magnus' Gift
    - This set provides more max magicka than Magnus' Gift
- Magnus' Gift  (3 pieces)
    - Use this set or Armor of the Seducer
    - This set provides more magicka Recovery than Seducer

### Healers
There are not very many good healing sets.  These are the best crafted sets available.  Generally, healers will be
looking to increase spell damage/healing.
- Kagrenac's Hope (5 pieces)
    - This or Julianos should be a healers main set.
- Law of Julianos (5 pieces)
    - This is or Kagrenac's should be a healers main set.
- Armor of the Seducer (3 pieces)
    - Use this set or Magnus' Gift
    - This set provides more max magicka than Magnus' Gift
- Magnus' Gift  (3 pieces)
    - Use this set or Armor of the Seducer
    - This set provides more magicka Recovery than Seducer

## Stamina Characters

### DPS
Stamina DPS should generall run dual wield builds + bow.  This means that on one bar you will have 7 armor slots and 2
weapons slots, meaning stam based characters benefit from a 5 piece set bonus and a 4 piece set bonus.  Jewelry should
be from the Agility set, but anything increasing your stamina pool will work.
- Hunding's Rage  (5 pieces)
    - This is, hands down, the best levelling set available.  It is very viable in all end game and veteran content.
- Night Mother's Gaze (4 pieces)
    - Use this or Morkuldin.
    - This set provides more weapon critical, but lower stamina regen and max stam than Morkuldin.
- Morkuldin (4 pieces)
    - Use this or Night Mother's Gaze.
    - This set provides more max stamina and stamina regen, but lower weapon critical than NMG.
